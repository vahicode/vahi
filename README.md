# VaHI v2

## What am I looking at? :thinking:

This is a work-in-progress to build version 2 of VaHI

After the initial work in the spring of 2018, VaHI has been running for 4 years now.
There's new interest in the system, but four years is a lifetime in frontend development.
So I felt it was best to build a new major version and port this to a more modern stack.
