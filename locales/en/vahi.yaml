tagline: A standardized grading system for limbal stem cell deficiency
welcomeTitle: Welcome to the VaHI grading tool
welcomeP1: "Limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) results from a range of pathologies such as chemical burns and aniridia. While the repertoire of treatment techniques expands and the number of limbal cell therapies grows, there is still a lack of objective outcome measures in grading this pathology. The different assessment techniques and subjective parameters challenge the grading of LSCD severity and impede objective comparison of treatment outcomes."
welcomeP2: "VaHI stands for <b>Vascularisation</b>, <b>Haze</b> and <b>Integrity</b>; 3 key clinical signs LSCD. Grading different clinical signs related to LSCD allows a simple way of documenting the severity of the condition and in evaluating outcomes after treatment. The VaHI software provides a new, improved and easy grading system for assessing and grading LSCD eyes. Feel welcome to discover this tool and join us for some simple and straightforward grading."
